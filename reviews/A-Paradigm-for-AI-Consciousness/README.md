"A Paradigm for AI Consciousness" position paper by Michael Edward Johnson has been accepted for publication at https://www.theseedsofscience.org/

The text attracted quite a bit of interest among potential reviewers, with 18 people submitting their votes (12 "yes", 6 "no") and 10 of those
people writing comments (5 of those comments were long, and my comment was particularly long).

I am posting a copy of my comment here: [AI-consciousness-comment.md](AI-consciousness-comment.md)

I'll add further links when they appear.
