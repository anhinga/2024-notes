Title:

_Pondering Invariant Properties of Self-Modifying Systems_

---

Abstract:
  * The studies of invariant properties of self-modifying systems is a subject which is quite neglected and which is likely to become fairly important in the near future.
  * It is likely that the ability to establish at least some approximately invariant properties of self-modifying systems will be important for any hopes to maintain any specific safety properties of the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem and of the world containing this ecosystem.
  * One conjecture I would like to ponder is that it is likely to be easier to maintain invariants in a situation where changes are gradual and continuous (especially, if the self-modifying ecosystem can control the rate at which the potentially most disruptive changes are phased in).
  * Let's ponder some possible technical directions which might allow us to make progress here.
